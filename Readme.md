# Why docker?
**Definition**: Docker is a software platform that allows us to build, test, and deploy applications quickly.

### Virtualization vs Containerization
!['image file'](arch.webp)

Let's talk about some core concept of virtualization and containerization: 
well all know about the **virtual machines** which are the virtualization or emulation of a computer system. Some characteristics of a virtual machines are:- 

- VMs emulate a physical computer and run an entire operating system (OS) stack.
- Each VM includes its own kernel, libraries, applications, and binaries.
- Hypervisors (such as VMware or VirtualBox) are used to manage VMs.
- VMs typically consume more resources due to the duplication of OS components.
- Startup time for VMs is relatively slower compared to containers.

A **container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Some characteristics of a containers are:- 

- Containers provide a lightweight and portable way to encapsulate application dependencies.
- Containers share the host OS kernel and only package the application code, libraries, and dependencies.
- Containers are highly efficient in terms of resource utilization and startup time.
- Isolation between containers is achieved through namespaces and control groups (cgroups).

SO, Docker manages the containers and it has some core features like:
- Image
- Container
- Network
- Volume
- Dockerfile
- Docker compose file

### Docker Images
Docker images are built using the Dockerfile, which consists of a set of instructions that are required to containerize an application

#### Docker Hub

```bash
docker pull <image_name>:<tag>
```

#### Dockerfile
```Dockerfile
# Start with a base image
FROM <base_image>

# Set metadata for an image
LABEL <key>=<value>

# Run commands in the image
RUN <command>

# Copy files or directories into the image
COPY <source> <destination>

# Define environment variables
ENV <key>=<value>

# Expose ports
EXPOSE <port>

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR <directory>

# Specify a default command to run when the container starts
CMD ["executable", "parameter1", "parameter2"]
```

#### A basic nginx server from alpine base image

```Dockerfile
# Use Alpine Linux as the base image
FROM alpine:latest

# Install Nginx and other dependencies
RUN apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache nginx && \
    mkdir -p /run/nginx

# Copy Nginx configuration files
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
COPY default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

!['image file'](image.png)

```bash
docker build -t image-name:tag -f path/to/Dockerfile .
```

### Find all docker images

```bash
docker images
```

## Docker containers
Container is a running instance of an image.

### Run a docker image as container (or image running as a process)

```bash
docker run -d --name <container_name> <image_name>:<tag>
```

```bash
docker run -d -p host_machine_port:docker_container_port test_nginx
```

### Now, How can we find our webpage running inside docker nginx server?

http://localhost:port/


### How can we share our file system with docker container?

```bash
docker run -v /host/directory:/container/directory
```

### Find all docker running container

```bash
docker ps
```

### stopping and removing the containers

```bash
docker container stop <name_of_the_container/id_of_the_container>
docker container rm <name_of_the_container/id_of_the_container>
docker container rm -f <name_of_the_container/id_of_the_container>
```


# Docker Networking

**Bridge Networking**
Bridge networking, also known as the default Docker network, creates an internal bridge network on the host.

```bash
docker network create my_bridge_network
```

```bash
docker run -d --network=my_bridge_network --name=my_container1 my_image1
```

```bash
docker run -d --network=my_bridge_network --name=my_container2 my_image2
```

```bash
docker exec -it my_container1 ping my_container2
```

**Host Networking**
Host networking removes network isolation between the Docker container and the Docker host.

```bash
docker run -d --network=host --name=my_container my_image
```
**Overlay Networking**
Overlay networking facilitates communication between containers running on different Docker hosts or Swarm nodes.


# Docker volumes
Docker volumes are a feature of Docker that provide a way to persistently store and manage data in containers. By default, the data in a container is stored in an ephemeral, writable container layer. Removing the container also removes it's data.

### Types of volumes
- Named Volumes: These are managed volumes created and managed by Docker. They are stored in a location controlled by Docker and are independent of the container's lifecycle.

- Host-mounted Volumes: These volumes are directories on the Docker host that are mounted directly into the container. Changes made in the container are reflected on the host and vice versa.

- Anonymous Volumes: These are temporary volumes created by Docker when no explicit volume is specified. They are useful for storing temporary or non-persistent data.

### Manage docker volumes

```bash
docker volume create my_volume
```

```bash
docker volume ls
```

```bash
docker volume inspect my_volume
```

```bash
docker volume rm my_volume
```

### Run docker container by mounting docker volume

```bash
docker run -v my_volume:/path/in/container my_image
```

### Run docker container by mounting docker volume in verbose way

```bash
docker run --name <container-name> -p 80:80 --mount type=volume,src=<volume-name>,target=<target-path-in-the-container> -d test_nginx
```

```bash
docker run --name nginx_container -p 80:80 --mount type=bind,src=<absolute-path-in-host>,target=<target-path-in-the-container> -d test_nginx
```

# Docker compose

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.appserver
    command: "uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - 8000:80
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - fast_api

  db:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.pgsql
    volumes:
      - psql_volume:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - fast_api

  pgadmin:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.pgadmin
    volumes:
      - pgadmin_volume:/var/lib/pgadmin
    ports:
      - "5050:80"
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@domain.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: admin
    networks:
      - fast_api

volumes:

  psql_volume:

```
### Build image, up and run the container with a single command
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Stop or down all the container with docker compose
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Managing development and production containers

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
```

### Run command in the container

```bash
docker-compose exec -it <service-name> <bash/shell>
```
